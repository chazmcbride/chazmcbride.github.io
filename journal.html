  <h2>Progression</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Finished The Jornal Page</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Today there were less challenges to navagate through today which was a welcoming change of pace. I definitely feel like I am making progress in learning css as a whole. Today I also noticed I didn't have to go looking for a solution to any problems I did have. Maybe that is attributed to the fact that today's project wasn't as complex as the last two projects. Either way I am striking that as a win. I also had a little bit of time to work on the design of my about page. I think it is 100% done for now. Code that thing up tomorrow and move on to the last project, the contact page. Once I feel that I have a working mobile site I am going to sit down and learn about the Developer Tools in Google Chrome and go through my css. From there it will be going through the code and look for ways to make the css smaller.</p>

  <h2>On A Flow But Ugly</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Goals Page & #100 Page</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>I don't even know where to begin with my css adventures today. I had a lot of spare time at work today. So i sat down and coded out Goals page. There was a lot of learning on  how to place items. The use of flexbox, always seems to be an issue. Sometimes I think I know what I am doing and then there are more moments of what...why...why not... oh wait...nope just kidding moments. I did get that wait I did it exactly like my design. Next. So that's what I did. I completed my #100 page also. I am 100% sure I can make the css smaller and maybe move the grid for #100 tracker to a whole different page. It was so overwhelming to look at. I know what I got to do, but first I'm putting focus on coding what I designed. This has been the most pages I have worked with and I am learning real quickly orgainzation is key to maintain sanity.</p>

  <h2>More Problems</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>My Official Personal Portfolio</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>So last night I spent a good three or more hours in the late night designing what I want my Personal Portfolio. I decided I needed to get back with git. Code Pen is awesome for quick on the fly or playing around with ideas, well maybe more than just that. I just needed something substantial with a clear cut direction. He is this thing now code it up. What I have learned so far with this build is tackle your problems one at a time. Once you get something where you want it or fixed something move down the list. Many small victories equal a better product at least for right now.  This is gonna be a project that I work until I feel it is 100% working copy of my design. I am starting from a mobile first aspect right now. So things may look a little weird above an iPad. This is my journey.</p>

  <h2>2019 and Flexbox Frustrations</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Flexbox Practice</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>So 2019 has officially kicked off and I in typical fashion am late on setting some goals. Things have changed in the past 13 days. My mindset has switched gears and I think it's time to create some goals and a road map. So that will be something I want to work on maybe this weekend.
  Yesterday was more flexbox play I built a simple static web page thing. I thought I kind of figured out flexbox but this morning I took the day off work because of sinus issues, but  flexbox and I were not seeing eye to eye. After being persistent to figuring flexbox out on a more complex project than yesterdays I think I am finally understanding its uses. I definitely want to practice more with it.</p>

  <h2>Final Project</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>FCC - Personal Portfolio</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>The last day of 2018. I know I am really ready for 2019 and the changes that are coming. This year is gonna be different. With that aside, today I finished the final project of the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp. You get what you put in. Now that the course is over its time to think about projects to create to put these skills to use.  Build a showcase of projects that I am really hyped on. This last project I used a bit of animations and strictly flexbox, no grid.
  Flexbox is frustrating but I need more practice with it. which is this week. Today wasn't terrible but it could have been better.</p>

  <h2>Flexbox Froggy</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Flexbox Froggy & More</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Woke up this morning and couldn't wait to sit down and work on a project. I knew exactly what I wanted to do this morning, which made it even more exciting. Since I am shifting my focus from grid to flexbox this week. The best way to kick it off is with flexbox froggy. It's basically like grid garden, but with flexbox and frogs. Really cool and easy to learn and understand.
  After I finished that, I was in such a flow I finished the fourth project in the responsive web design curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. Which made me realize that I have one more project left. Normally I would switch gears and move on to the javascript, but I've  decided that this 100 Days of Code Challenge is strictly putting my focus on CSS3. There is so much to learn and I know I wont learn it all but I'll know where to find info to help learn the pieces I don't know.
  Let's get flexy!</p>

  <h2>Finished Project Number 3</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>FCC-Product Landing Page Project Part 2</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Today I turned 40. Another project down. This one introduced the use of flexbox. Now I don't have anything against flexbox, I just haven't learned it yet. Now that I feel a lot more comfortable with grid I think flexbox is going to be the focus for the next week. I am kind of excited to learn this. That's what I find fascinating about learning to code. The learning process never ends. There is a constant movement.</p>

  <h2>Meh</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>FCC-Product Landing Page Project Part 1</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Well I did it again, I had wanted to design it first before I started coding but nope I thought it would a good idea to just do it on the fly again. Not really digging doing it this way but I, well I'm not gonna give any excuses. I am kind of taking my time with this one because at some point I have to use flex box in this project. Which is fine, I'm just getting used to grids not confident enough to add some flex in the mix yet. It's cool though in order to progress you have to do things you don't want to even if the timing is not on par with your time.</p>

  <h2>On To The Next</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>FCC-Survey Form Project Part 2</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Finally finished the survey form project on FreeCodeCamp. I don't know what it is about forms but I don't like them. I understand the importance of them, but I don't like them and that's ok. In order to progress you have to do the things you don't like to do.  A lot of it is probably need more practice with them but I like messing with grids right now, mind you I did use grid while making this. Using grids to me makes making responsive sites a lot more easy. So take aways from this project. Design it first; period. Then code it out, look for ways to shorten your code, and take breaks it's ok.</p>

  <h2>Procrastination</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>FCC-Survey Form Project Part 1</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Finding time is challenging during the work week. I have also been procrastinating on doing this project long enough. It is time to get this one over with. I think a lot of my frustration is coming from not designing the project first. Instead I am trying to design on the fly and I am not good at doing that. I am the type of person who has to see the final or close to the final to know what I'm doing. That actually goes for the same at work. Anytime I am building something I need to see what it looks like first. I have a hard time visualizing the final. So lesson learned is no matter how much more time it takes, take time to prototype it first and then build.</p>

  <h2>Another Early Morning</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Grid Practice</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Another early morning session. This one was a little different than actually coding something from start to finish. I was scanning through twitter and came across a post in my feed that mentioned a site called Grid Garden. It's basically a site that helps you understand grid in a more easy and gameful way.  I learned a lot more of grid than most videos I have watched and I say learned but I also mean understanding what I was doing and why I was doing it and the different ways to do the same thing.</p>

  <h2>Early Morning Sesh</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Grid Practice</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Woke up pretty early things morning and got my coffee going and sat straight down and started playing with grids. I love early morning sessions like that. There is no thinking about doing it, it's just go do it. Sit back be proud. It's been a while since I had a creative sesh like that.  I have plans to animate of have the colors in the boxes look like they are flowing. Maybe that will be my next focus after grids. Animation and transitions or something like that.</p>
  <p>Update: </p>
  <p>I decided to play with animations for a bit. its kind of basic but it gets me used to the syntax. It was really fun to experiment with.</p>

  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Grid Practice</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Woke up refreshed and much ready to sit down and work. So going over what I did last night I decided to change it up. I decided this week I will be focusing on grid practice. I am doing simple profile card layouts first, then once I get a little more comfortable I'll start coding more complicated grid layouts. Having a little trouble with grids inside grids. Thats when it get's a little crazy. Putting borders on things helps with the visual side of moving things around with grid.</p>

  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Extremely tired today. Had to work my regular job all day and then get the kids packed up and ready to go to Texas so they can spend Christmas with their mom. Really feeling unmotivated to sit down and code, but I forced myself to quickly get something out. Gonna work on it more tomorrow. Fell asleep while coding a couple of times. Tomorrow is a whole new day.</p>

  <h2>Ready Set Go</h2>
  <h2>TODAY'S PROGRESS</h2>
  <p>Designed and Built the Tribute Page on FreeCodeCamp.</p>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>So last week I started and finished the Responsive Web Design Certification. A lot of it was pretty basic stuff that I already knew, so I felt like it didn't take that long. I am single father of two kids with a full time job, so finding time to sit down and put that work in can be quite a challenge.  Today I finally sat down and did the first project for the course which was a simple Tribute page. I took some time to design what I wanted it to look like in Abobe XD first and then I coded it based of it. the project took me a couple of hours from start to finish. I am definitely hyped on how it came out and for sure learned so much. It is definitely a confidence booster. I can't wait to get started on the next project.</p>

  <h2>Setting It All Up</h2>
  <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
  <p>Last night I watched a video from FreeCodeCamp about a #100daysofcode challenge. So after that video I did a little more research on this challenge and found this is exactly what I have been needing.  I have recently been interested in Web Development. To be honest I have dabbled in it more than a few times, so I have a pretty good understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS. This is different than just playing with it for a little bit . I am ready to take this a lot more seriously.  So today has been a day of learning Git and Github. Now that I got the basics of Git and Github down. The time to start this journey is fast approaching.</p>
