    <p>Hello, I'm Chaz!</p>
    <p>I am a maker.  I make a wide range of things from a wide range of materials. My main love is building fixtures for retail owner’s. During the week I work at the Urban Outfitters in Jax. I build all their displays in house. I have also built a few projects for a couple of local retailers in the Jax area as well. If you are interested in getting a fixture built whether it’s for a pop-up shop, a market space, or a full build out of a brick and mortar store, Come talk with me. I like to make dreams a reality so your retail store can thrive and look exceptional while doing it.
    </p>
    <p>I have also ventured out in the makerspace and have been working on Website Development and Design. This is something that is very new to me and has invigorated my passion for learning new things. When I have gained more skills and confident to bring you the best Web Development for your small retail business or personal branding, this will be a service that will be offered up as well.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by, take a look around at the different projects I have done in the past. Hopefully you get inspired by the things that inspire me as well. Let's work together.
    </p>
    <p>p.s. I built this site from hand as well.</p>
